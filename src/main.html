<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This system is made with two parts completely separated. The frontend also have rendering engine which treats markdown and LaTeX syntax, code highlighting. The frontend just communicates the backend to get auth-tokens and markdown sources. The backend just do authentification and authorization and send sources or update sources. Now we trying to make many backends implemented various languages to run on a lot of environment. First of all I prepare PHP backend. I have plan to make Common Lisp backend and JavaScript backend. And I notice you that it is avalable on Github Pages standalone. Our demo site has no backend just run with apache, we call this mode HTML backend.</p>
