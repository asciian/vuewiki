# WikiBox 
WikiBox is inspired by [MDWiki](https://mdwiki.info/), which is a static site generator without any building steps. MDWiki works with jQuery and Bootstrap 3, and WikiBox modernize it using React and Bootstrap 4 to be faster and beautiful. Of course LaTeX syntaxed equations are also upgraded to MathJax v3.
